        This activity was much more to me than<br> just a Spectator, I was watching my father<br> played against the alumniof the <br>Silliman University. I expected
        this activity to be<br> great and I wasn't wrong. I really<br> enjoy watching my Dad and his<br> teammates play the game.<br> My father taught<br> me how to play Basketball<br>
        and he is my inspiration to<br> become much better everyday.<br><br>I saw the benefit of this activity, I got inspired<br> and got some motivation to improve myself<br>
        from the game. Because of this activity,<br> I am much confident on my skills rather <br>than just be shy and not play at all.<br> I learned how to train my body well
        and<br> how I need to get out of comfort zones to<br> reach the goal that I want in terms<br> of academically and physically.</p>
    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div2">11/23/22(7:00pm)<br>SUMVT College vs COSCA College!<br>Silliman University<br>Spectator<br><br>
        During this activity, I watched as the SUMVT College<br> fought against COSCA college. I expected<br> this activity to be exciting, even though I don't<br>
        know much about Volleyball, I still got excited<br> because of how thrill the game was. Both teams<br> played it very well and non of the team gave up.<br><br>
        The benefit I got on this activity was to<br> work really hard so that my idols would<br> become my rivals someday.<br> Because of this activity, I am now a much<br>
        more hardworking person than I was yesterday.<br> I learned to now give up the moment things become<br> hard and just keep on moving forward no matter<br>
        what happens. Because<br> all of it will eventually be worth it in the end.</p>

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div3">08/23/22(5:00-7:00pm)<br>MLBB: Tournament Finals<br>CCS Hibalag<br>Participant<br><br>
        During this day, we got together with my team.<br> I expected this day to be hard but yet fun.<br> I was very nervous at first because
        I have<br> a hobbit of getting nervous in crucial times.<br> We were all having fun and even though<br> we lost to our opposing team, we still<br> had a
        good run in the Tournament.<br> I learned from this activity that even<br> if you lose, as long as you're giving<br> it your all and have fun while playing,<br>
        it would all be good. Because of<br> this activity, I am happier than I was<br> yesterday. I get to meet some new friends<br> in the Silliman especially that I'm<br>
        still new to the school.<br> We built friendship through<br> the Tournament even if we lost.

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div4">08/22/22(5:00-7:00pm)<br>MLBB: Tournament Elimination<br>CCS Hibalag<br>Participant<br><br>
        This activity I was a Participant, I was nervous<br> at first because I don't know who my teammates are.<br> I expected this day to be scary and tiring.<br>
        We talked with my team and what I expected<br> turns out to be wrong. They're all friendly<br> and we had fun during the first day<br> of the tournament.
        The benefit I got on this activity<br> was that I learned to not trust<br> everything that I think. I learned<br> to just go with the flow and see what happens<br>
        at the end of the day. Because<br> of this activity, I am much friendly to everyone<br> and I gained alot of new friends. I learned<br> how to socialize
        instead of just<br> keeping myself away from other people.</p>
