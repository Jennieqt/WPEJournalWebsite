        During this activity,<br>we were first tasked to make<br> a Banner which was about the bible. I<br> learned on how to pray properly<br> and my expectations changed because I thought <br>at first it would be boring but we were all<br> having fun and had a
        Bible study together<br> as a section during the fellowship.<br><br> My faith during these this <br>activity were strengthened.<br> It affected my view on the world to a <br>much better because of the<br> bible study. Because of this activity, <br>I am now interested
        in participating bible<br> study and worshiping the Lord.</p>

        My expectations<br> on the event was that it will be the same the one I<br> attended on my city back when I was a Junior High.<br> But I was amaze on how beautifully it was<br> presented and how all songs were very astonishing.<br>
        I’ll continue with these environments by always<br> participating on the future related events.<br>
        Because of this activity, I am now much clearer<br> to my goals, my faith has improved and it<br> has truly help me in my life. </p>

        My role during this activity was to make a Letter to God.<br> At first my expectations was very low because I’m not used<br>
        to writing a letter. But as I went on the activity I was <br>able to express much more than what I had expected<br> to the activity.
        I saw the benefits of this activity because through it I know<br> now that by writing I can express what I usually express.
        Because of this activity,<br> I am now a much better person and the heavy things on my heart was lighten.</p>
        <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div4">August 21, 2022 5:30pm-7:00pm<br>My first mass in Dumaguete City<br>Parish Church<br>Participant<br><br>
        I was very much challenged during my first mass<br>here in Dumaguete because I am not from this city<br> and I barely know some people here<br>
        I decided to visit the church together with my girlfriend<br> and we didn't regret that we attended the mass<br> even though we barely
        know the places on this city.<br> Because of this activity, I learned to get out of my<br> shell, meaning I learned to not stay on my<br> comfort zone and 
        be a much better person. </p>
