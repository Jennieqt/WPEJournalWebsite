    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div1">10/13/22(9:00am)<br>Practical Swimming<br>Ma’am Kathleen Dellona<br>Participant<br><br>
        I was a participant furing our practical Swimming.<br> I learned alot of new skills, at first<br> I was nervous because we were all about<br>
        to try what we have learned from<br> our training sessions and I was scared<br> because I'm not confident on my swimming<br> skills.<br><br> I expected
        to fail the practical test,<br> but as it turns out I was able to make it<br> through all the way of the practical.<br> I was so proud of myself because<br>
        I didn't know I was much more capable<br> than what I think I am. I will<br>continue to on this kind of environment by<br> still taking up PE Swimming on the<br>
        semester. Because of this activity, I am<br> now much confident on my skills,<br> I have learned to conquer my fear<br>  and have the courage to take
        on the challenge.</p>
    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div2">11/09/22(12:00pm)<br>Campus Tour!<br>Ma’am Joy Dy<br>Participant<br><br>
        During this activty, I expected the<br> activity to be boring because I am<br> not much into discovering new ideas/things/knowldege.<br>
        But then again I was proven wrong<br> because I had fun on our tour,<br> especially because our tour guide was<br> so detailed about the buildings
        on<br> the Silliman University.<br><br> My friends and I<br> had so much fun during the activity,<br> I learned how to be patient and I learned<br> that
        tours can also be fun.<br> I saw the benefits of this activity,<br> I was able to have patience at the<br> same time had some fun on the tour which<br>
        I find myself surprising. If I could do<br> the project again, I would still do the same.<br> It's really worth it to get out of our<br> comfort zones,
        we spend so much time on our<br> comfort zones that we forgot what we<br> are capable of. Becuase of this activity,<br> I am now a much better person
        than<br> I was yesterday, I learned how to<br> have fun in ways I didn't encounter.

        I was a participant during our practical fitness gym,<br> this time I expected myself to do good<br> because back when I was on my Junior High<br>
        I played so many sports and I was<br> really very much into sports.<br> My expectations were correct, I<br> didn't had much struggle and I<br> completed it just
        enough sweat.<br> I did learn so many new skills, like<br> how to properly push up, sit-ups and jumping rope.<br><br> It was amazing because I didn't know<br>
        how to do these skills properly but<br> through the session I was able<br> to do it properly because of our trainings.<br> I saw the benefit of this activity<br>
        by working out everyday, I was<br> able to build consistency because<br> of our PE practical test. I would<br> still do the same if I could do it again.<br> Because of this
        activity,<br> I am able to build consistency<br> and discipline myself to have a better<br> body. I learned that, nothing really<br> comes easy, great things
        takes<br> time and all we need is hard<br> work and consistency. We must<br> give everything that we have so that<br> we can get what we want in our lives.

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div4">12/14/22(5:30pm)<br>Final Meet in CCS1<br>Sir Kim Faburada<br>Participant<br><br>
        During this activity, we were all<br> taking up the Final Examination on CCS1.<br> I was very nervous, I expected<br> myself to fail this exam because
        my<br> fear got the best of me. Before<br> we started the exam, our teacher<br> surprised us with some snacks before<br> we take the exam. Because of that<br>
        I had calm myself and was able to<br> take the exam without any fear.<br><br> I saw the benefit of this activity<br> because after that exam, I realized<br> that
        I should not let the<br> fear take over me, instead I<br> should take over my fear. I have learned<br> to conquer my fears during the next<br> examinations and 
        it really helped me.<br> Because of this activity, I am<br> now much confident on my knowldege<br> accademically. It really is amazing<br> how conquering our 
        worries<br> will help us in our daily lives.<br> I really encourage everyone <br>to start conquering their fears.

        This activty was very fun and tiring at the same time. I expected this activity to be very tired. And yes I was correct, it was very exhausting<br>
        but at the same time it was very fun. Why exhausting? Because it was very hot that day but we were all preparing for our final presentation for<br>
        that same day and we had so much fun.<br><br> I learned one new skill that day, that is how to walk properly during our marching. I am able to continue
        my involvement with this kind of invironment because I will still need to take my ROTC on the next semester. Because of this<br>
        activity, I was able to understand how important teamwork is. Because without teamwork our trainings would have not been good. <br>

        I expected this activity to be a<br> little more serious. Because it<br> tackles on where we will be in<br> our future. And I was amaze how amazing<br> they
        oriented to us freshmens about<br> the career path that we are taking.<br><br> The benefit of this activity<br> is that I got enlightened that I picked the<br>
        right course, I was first doubting my<br> course but it was all washed away. Because<br> of this activity, I am very sure on the career<br> path that I am taking.
        I was inspired<br> by my brother and sister as they are both<br> software engineer and both of them<br> are graduates of Computer Engineering.</p>
