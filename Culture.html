    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div1">08/22/22(3:00pm)<br>Parada Sillimaniana<br>Silliman University<br>Participant<br><br>
        During this event, I expected it<br> to be fun and exciting because<br> it's my first time attending this kind<br> of event. And what I expected was correct,<br>
        The Parada Sillimaniana was a<br> very fun event, I have heard this from<br> my sister and I didn't know<br> it was so much more than what<br> she said.<br><br> I can continue
        to be<br> involve in this kind of environment<br> by always go have some fun during the<br> Hibalag that will come in the future.<br> I saw the benefit of this activity because<br>
        I have made friends with these<br> guys in the photo and we are on the same<br> course. If I could do it again then I<br> would still do the same as<br> I did. Because of this activity,<br>
        I am amazed on how it really<br> great to be here in Silliman University.<br> It was just my dream to go here but<br> I have realized that my dream has finally came true.</p>
    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div2">10/12/22(5:00pm)<br>Freshie Walk<br>Silliman University<br>Participant<br><br>
        In this activty, I expected it to<br> be fun and exciting because I was<br> with some of my new friends and other<br> people from the other departments whom I met.<br> And indeed it was very fun being
        able<br> to socialize and talk with our<br> experiences on Silliman University.<br><br> I don't know if socializing is a new skill<br> but I did learn that because of<br> this activity I saw the benefit of this<br>
        activity because I saw myself<br> being able to interact more<br> on others whichI don't usually<br> do because of how shy of a<br> person I am. If I could do this again<br> I would still do the same and have<br>
        the same fun with the same group<br> I was with. Because of this activity, I<br> am able to socialize more and make alot<br> of new friends without being<br> anxious to what other people think.<br> Having been
        able to participate the<br> freshie walk is such a blessing. </p>

        During the Presentation of Sponsors,<br> I expected for it to be hard<br> because of the pressure. We were<br> all nervous because alot of people<br> were watching us perform
        the<br> Presentation of Sponsors. We were<br> all so nervous but at the end<br>of the day we were able to get it done,<br> through our teamwork we performed it<br> perfectly.<br><br> I saw the benefits
        of this<br> activity because I am much more<br> confident done I was before.<br> If I could do it again I would<br> still do the same and be with the same <br>platoon in the ROTC.
        Because of this activity,<br> I am much more responsible on<br> the tasks given to me <br>and be more serious.</p>

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div4">08/26/22(8:00pm)<br>Miss Silliman Coronation Night<br>Silliman University<br>Spectator<br><br>
        My role on this activity was a spectator,<br> I watched as our amazing womens<br> go at it to get the crown of the<br> Silliman University. I expected the<br>
        activity to be amazing and my expectations<br> was correct. It was very beautiful how<br> the event went through the night. I <br>was surprise how beautiful
        the Miss Sillman<br> compare to the one back in my city. Through<br> this experience I was able to change <br>what I currently view on our world.<br><br>I was stunned by
        the quotes of the competitors<br> because of how amazing they delivered it.<br> Especially the women equality and empowerment.<br> And that is the benefit I received that<br>
        day, me being a much kinder<br> person towards other people. Because of this<br> activity, I am much more obligated to be<br> kind to everyone. We don't know
        what<br> a person is going through, being<br> kind to everyone wouldn't hurt a thing.

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div5">08/17/22(4:00pm)<br>Miss Silliman Press launch<br>Silliman University<br>Spectator<br><br>
        My role on this activity was also a spectator, I expected<br> this activity to be a little bit boring and tiring.<br> And I was wrong once again, I was having fun<br>
        as they presented the Miss Silliman Press Launch.<br> There were alot of people supporting their representative<br> and I got to witness that amazing crowd.<br><br>
        I saw the benefit of this activity, as I was watching with my girlfriend<br> I learned how to have more patience and control it.<br> I usually don't attend to this
        kind of events<br> because I find it boring but I learned on how to get<br> out of my shell. Because of this activity,<br> I am much interactive with other persons<br>
        and learned to get out of my <br>comfort zone instead of staying on it.</p>

    <p style="color: burlywood;"id="div6">12/03/22(7:00pm)<br>Jazz Christmas<br>Silliman University<br>Spectator<br><br>
        On this activity, I was a spectator on the Jazz Christmas. I expected this activity to be little bit ofboring because I didn't know what this
        activity was all about. I just went on the activity and as I was listening to the amazing performances of the show, I was getting excited and
        were very happy that I went on to watch the show.<br><br> It has affected on how I view the world because I find Christmas Eve nowadays to be a little bit of boring
        compare to back when I was still a kid. But I got reminded that Christmas is much more than that, it's about being with my family and loved ones and celebrating
        the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.I saw the benefit of this activity, I got reminded on how beautiful Christmas Eve is. Because of this activity
        I am looking forward to Christmas that will come, to be with my family and express how much I love and treasure them. And celebrate the birthday of Jesus.</p>
