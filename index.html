        <i> I am Angelo Tan, first year taking the course of Computer Science.<br> So why computer science? I was inspired
            by my older brother and sister<br> to become a software engineer, although both of them are graduates as  Computer Engineer<br>
            here in Silliman University. My dream was to become a pilot, but it was impossible financially<br> so as my second option I
            proceeded to take up Computer Science which will soon <br>lead to become a software engineer.This is me! Here is a glimpse 
            of my 1st semester.<br>Kindly Click the links that can be seen above.</h3></center></i>
